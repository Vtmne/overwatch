            <p>I was born in Selma, California on July 17th, 1986. I lived in Selma until the 8th grade, that was when I moved 
            to Fresno and spent the rest of my life as well as a year between the ages of 12 and 13 in Los Angeles. I graduated
            from Sunnyside High Scool in 2005.</p>

            <p>I enlisted right out of High School at the age of 17in 2004.I turned 18 while in boot camp and didn't tell anyone unlike
            Pvt Jackson who thought it would be a good idea to let the Drill Sargeant know it was his birthday, he got smoked all day.
            After boot camp I arrived at the beautiful Fort Huachuca, Arizona and began Interrogator training. I deployed to Afghanistan 
            from 2007-2008 in support of OEF VIII.

            <p>My future goal is to do something that I find fulfilling and serves a purpose. Also, I hope that with this new skill that I
            hope to acquire I can create something that serves my community, both Veteran and Fresnan in general.</p>
